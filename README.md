Hello!

This is my final project for the CodersLab course, in which I am preparing an online shop based on the FakeStore API.

The project relies on several features, such as:

React
Redux / Redux Toolkit
Tailwind (which is not required to pass the exam)
Docker
Tests (React Testing Library, Jest/Vitest, Playwright)

My goal is to create an online shop that is user-friendly, smooth, and visually appealing.
